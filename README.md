# Top 30 Most Viewed YouTube Videos Visualization

Using the power of Beautiful Soup to scrape data from wikipedia article.
This script feteches the latest data from [List of most-viewed YouTube videos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos) article over on wikipedia.

I used this [blog](https://www.pylenin.com/blogs/web-scraping-python-bs4/) as a reference for this project.

# Feuture Updates:

1. Make Visulaiztion using this data.
2. Make this an in general script so that any table can be scraped from any article on Wikipedia.
3. Error handling to check wether a link is provided for the article.
